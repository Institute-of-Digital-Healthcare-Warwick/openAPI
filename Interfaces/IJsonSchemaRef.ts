/**
 * JSON Schema reference
 * 
 * Even though the value of a $ref is a URI-reference, it is not a network locator, only an identifier.
 * This means that the schema doesnâ€™t need to be accessible at the resolved URI, but it may be.
 * It is basically up to the validator implementation how external schema URIs will be handled, but one should not assume the validator will fetch network resources indicated in $ref values
 * 
 * These paths need to be specified for the Mapper API
